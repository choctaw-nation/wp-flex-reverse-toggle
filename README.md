# WP Flex Reverse Toggle

This little package exports a single function, `addFlexReverseToggle` that wires up an extra toggle component to reverse the flex direction of certain core blocks.

**Note:** The source file is currently only built in Typescript. Be sure to import it into a Typescript file!

## Blocks

1. `core/group`
2. `core/columns`

## Getting Started & Sample Usage

1. Import the `addFlexReverseToggle` function into your working file
2. Enqueue your working file into the WP Admin with the `enqueue_block_editor_assets` hook

```ts
// the rest of your JS/TS file to edit the Block Editor....

function alterBlocks(): void {
	// namespace can be anything, and should be unique to your plugin/theme
	const namespace = 'cno-starter-theme';
	addFlexReverseToggle(namespace);
}
alterBlocks();

// the rest of your JS/TS file to edit the Block Editor....
```
